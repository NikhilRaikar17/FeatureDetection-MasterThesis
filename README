Extracting requirements from keywords

Approach : Clustering using Kmeans Approach.

Main_Dependencies :
1. Python > 3
2. Nltk
3. sklearn


Approach Description:
  1. Clustering similar sentences.
  2. Frequency and Pos Tags based approach used to get relevant keywords from the set of requirements corpus.
  3. Adjectives followed by a Noun pair formulate a good keyword.(also Noun followed by a Noun)
  4. Pairs of these are extracted from the corpus and evaluated.

Evaluation against Groudn Truth :
  1. Better results with ground truth.
  2. Against textrank also as a evaluation parameter.(Added parameter)
  3. Works better than all other models.


Tree Construction approaches tried:
1. Similarity based approach can be used.
2. occurrence based approaches can be used.

Bias/ApproachTunning:
1. Number of cluster selection has to be evaluated with more hyperparameters.
